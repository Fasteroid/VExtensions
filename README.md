## VRMod Functions

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Expression-yes-green)

Allows you to use VRMod's SHARED functions if VRMod is installed on your server.
This gives you access to anyone in VR's head placement, angle and hand placement, etc.

## Selfaware 2
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/StarfallEx-no-red)
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Expression-yes-green)

Adds more functions that are more 'selfaware' just like e2's general selfaware.lua core
Two currently added are getFunctionPath(s) to get the file path of an e2function, and ifdef(s) to basically be able to use #ifdef, just in runtime.

## Other Misc. Functions:
E2: rangerSetFilter(array filter), sets the filter of your e2 rangers.
E2: hideChatPly(entity ply,number yes), hides the chat of a player selected (by default enabled, but warns you when it is hidden and you can disable it with canhidechatply_cl

SF: player:setEyeAngles(angle ang)
