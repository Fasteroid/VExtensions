# CONTRIBUTING.md

## How can I contribute?
If you feel that you want something to be added to VExtensions, feel free to make a [Discussion](https://github.com/Vurv78/VExtensions/discussions),
[Issue](https://github.com/Vurv78/VExtensions/issues) or
[Pull Request](https://github.com/Vurv78/VExtensions/pulls) to suggest for something to be added, or to add it yourself.

I currently don't really have any styling rules besides please don't use the C syntax that Garry added to GMod. (Being: `` /*, !=, !VAR ``, etc.)
